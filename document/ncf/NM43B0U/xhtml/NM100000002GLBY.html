          with "Apple CarPlay" Function)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) To utilize the "Apple CarPlay"
          function, it is necessary to connect a compatible iPhone
          to the audio head unit using a USB cable or "Wi-Fi"
          wireless connection. When the connection is detected and
          certified using the screen prompts, "Apple CarPlay" is
          displayed on the multi-display.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Users can operate the iPhone on the
          multi-display, such as by displaying the iPhone's map on
          the multi-display by operating the "Apple CarPlay" screen
          and outputting registered music files from the vehicle
          speakers. For details, refer to
