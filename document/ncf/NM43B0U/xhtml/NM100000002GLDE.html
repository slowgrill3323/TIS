          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The parking assist monitor system
          assists the driver by displaying an image of the view
          behind the vehicle while backing up, for example while
          parking. When the display is changed to the wide rear
          view mode, a wider lateral view behind the vehicle will
          be displayed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The parking assist monitor system
          has a rear television camera assembly mounted on the
          tailgate to display a view of the area behind the vehicle
          on the radio and display receiver assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) This system consists of the rear
          television camera assembly and radio and display receiver
          assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The rear television camera assembly
          controls the parking assist monitor system.</p>

            <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
            <ul class="note">
              <li>The parking assist monitor system is a system
              that helps the user to confirm the conditions of the
              rear of the vehicle. Always drive while directly
              confirming the surroundings of the vehicle
              (particularly the area to the rear).</li>
              <li>Pedestrians and obstacles that are displayed on
              the screen may differ from the actual location and
              distance due to the characteristics of the lens in
              the rear television camera assembly.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) When driving, directly confirm the
          surroundings of the vehicle (particularly the area to the
          rear). Failure to do so can lead to unforeseen accidents,
          such as collisions with other vehicles, etc. Make sure to
          observe the following precautions when using the parking
          assist monitor system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not rely entirely on the parking
          assist monitor system. When backing up, drive the vehicle
          as carefully as you would drive one that is not equipped
          with the parking assist monitor system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Always drive while directly
          confirming the surroundings of the vehicle (particularly
          the area to the rear).</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Back up slowly by depressing the
          brake pedal to adjust the speed.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Never attempt to back up the vehicle
          only by observing the screen. If you do so, you could
          unexpectedly crash the vehicle or cause an accident
          because the image on the screen could differ from the
          actual situation. While backing up, also make sure to use
          the inside and outside rear view mirrors in order to
          directly verify the safety of the rear and surrounding
          areas.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) The position of the guide lines
          displayed on the screen may differ depending on the
          number of passengers, load capacity and incline of the
          road. Always drive while directly confirming the
          surroundings of the vehicle (particularly the area to the
          rear).</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) The operation procedure for each
          mode of the parking assist monitor system is just an
          example, and the timing and amount of operation of the
          steering wheel will vary depending on the road
          conditions, road surface and vehicle conditions during
          parking. Please use the parking assist monitor system
          after fully understanding the above. Also, when parking,
          make sure you can park your car in the parking space
          before operating.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) Do not use the parking assist
          monitor under the following situations.</p>

                      <li>The vehicle is driven on a road that is
                      not even, such as a slope.</li>
                      <li>The vehicle is driven on a road that is
                      not straight, such as curved roads.</li>
                      <li>Tires outside of the specified size are
                      equipped.</li>

          <p class="step3">(8) When the outside air temperature is
          low, the screen may become darker or appear faint. Since
          moving objects in particular may become distorted or
          disappear, always drive carefully while directly
          confirming the safety of your surroundings.</p>
          <p class="step3">(9) When tires are replaced, the
          position indicated by the guide lines displayed on the
          screen may differ slightly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(10) If you contact a vehicle, obstacle
          or pedestrian nearby or run onto the sides of the road,
          depress the brake pedal and stop the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(11) Pedestrians and obstacles that are
          displayed on the screen may differ from the actual
          location and distance due to the characteristics of the
          lens in the rear television camera assembly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(12) The position of the guide lines
          displayed on the screen may differ depending on the
          number of passengers, load capacity, etc. Always drive
          while directly confirming the surroundings of the vehicle
          (particularly the area to the rear).</p>
          <p class="step3">(13) The vehicle width guide lines are
          displayed wider than the actual vehicle width. While
          driving in reverse, always confirm the surroundings of
          the vehicle (particularly the area to the rear).</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Area Displayed on Screen</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The display area may differ
          depending on the vehicle and road conditions.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The area covered by the rear
          television camera assembly is limited. The rear
          television camera assembly does not show objects close to
          either corner of the bumper or show items under the
          bumper. The clearance distance that appears on the screen
          is different from the actual distance because the rear
          television camera assembly uses a wide-angle lens.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) An object that is positioned higher
          than the rear television camera assembly may not be
          displayed on the screen.</p>

          <p class="step2">(c) Rear Television Camera Assembly
          Precautions</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The camera is unable to capture a
          clear image if the glass in front of the lens is dirty.
          Therefore, clean the glass if it has water drops, snow or
          dirt on it.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Make sure to follow the precautions
          below to ensure the parking assist monitor system
          operates normally.</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Do not subject the camera to strong
                      impacts by hitting it, throwing objects at
                      it, etc. The installation position and angle
                      of the camera may become misaligned.</li>
                      <li>The camera has a waterproof structure. Do
                      not remove, disassemble or modify the
                      camera.</li>
                      <li>When cleaning the camera lens, wash the
                      camera with a large amount of water and wipe
                      the lens with a wet soft cloth. Do not
                      strongly rub the camera lens. Otherwise, the
                      lens may get damaged and the camera may not
                      be able to capture clear images.</li>
                      <li>The cover of the camera is made of resin.
                      Do not apply organic solvents, wax, oil film
                      remover, glass coating, etc. If the camera is
                      contaminated, immediately wipe it off.</li>
                      <li>Do not subject the camera to sudden
                      temperature changes such as by pouring hot
                      water into the camera under cold
                      weather.</li>
                      <li>When washing the vehicle with a
                      high-pressure washer, do not spray water on
                      the rear television camera assembly or
                      surrounding area. High-pressure water can
                      damage the camera.</li>

          <p class="step3">(3) If the camera is hit, a malfunction
          may occur. Have the vehicle inspected by your dealer as
          soon as possible.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Road Condition Precautions</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Depending on the number of
          occupants, the load conditions, the slope of the road,
          and bumps in the road, a disparity may occur between the
          display indication and the actual distance on the road
          surface. Operate the vehicle carefully.</p><img src="../images/Y311918C01.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">

              <li>The distance indication as shown on the screen
              varies between 3-dimensional objects such as a
              vehicle and a flat plane such as the road surface. As
              shown in the following illustrations, points A and B
              are actually vertically aligned and point C is
              farther away from them, however, the points are
              displayed in order of distance from the vehicle, B, C
              and A. Therefore, the vehicle will come into contact
              with the 3-dimensional object if it is backed to
              point B on the screen. <img src="../images/Y311921E01.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">

              not match.</li>
              <li>When only one parking line is provided, the
