          <p class="step1">SYSTEM CONTROL</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Downhill assist control is a system
          that enables stable driving down steep slopes by
          controlling the brake fluid pressure of the 4 wheels
          automatically to maintain a set low vehicle speed while
          preventing the tires from locking. The vehicle speed
          switching function also enables the vehicle speed to be
          controlled with a switch operation.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) This is effective when driving down
          steep slopes where sufficient deceleration is not
          possible with only the engine brake.</p><img src="../images/X118549E02.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">

          </div>
          <p class="step2">(d) Downhill Assist Control Effects</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The vehicle can be controlled to a
          set low vehicle speed when driving down a steep slope,
          enabling the driver to concentrate on the steering
          operation without needing to worry about operating the
          brake or accelerator.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) On slippery slopes as well, the
          vehicle can be driven downhill at a low vehicle speed
          without locking the tires, and on rough and bumpy slopes,
          the vehicle can be driven downhill with minimal shaking,
          which helps ensure vehicle stability.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The tires do not lock during
          downhill assist control, which helps ensure steering
          performance when avoiding obstacles or changing
          lanes.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Downhill Assist Control
          Description</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Information such as the DAC/CRAWL
          switch and drive mode signals, and whether the
          accelerator and brake are operated, is input from the
          various sensors and ECUs, and the availability of
          downhill assist control operation is determined.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The target speed is determined from
          the inclination angle and operation of the mode selection
          switch by the driver.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The vehicle acceleration condition
          is detected from the speed of each wheel. When control is
          determined to be necessary, the brake fluid pressure of
          each wheel is controlled to make the speed of each wheel
          converge with the target vehicle speed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Vehicle Speed Switching Function</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The set vehicle speed can be
          switched by operating the mode select switch during
          downhill assist control. During switching, the set
          vehicle speed is displayed on the multi-information
          display.</p>
