          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The occupant classification system
          judges whether the front passenger seat is occupied by an
          adult or child (with a child seat) or is unoccupied, in
          accordance with the load that is applied to the front
          passenger seat and whether the seat belt is fastened.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) This system restricts the deployment
          of the SRS front passenger airbag and SRS front passenger
          knee airbag.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The system informs the driver of the
          result of the judgment through the use of the AIRBAG
          ON/OFF indicator lights.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) This system consists of 2 occupant
          classification sensors, AIRBAG ON/OFF indicator lights, a
          front passenger seat belt buckle switch and an airbag
          ECU.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) To avoid potential death or serious
          injury due to the occupant classification system not
          detecting the conditions correctly, observe the
          following:</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Wear the seat belt properly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Make sure that the front passenger
          seat belt tongue has not been left inserted into the
          buckle before someone sits in the front passenger
          seat.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Make sure that the AIRBAG ON
          indicator light is illuminated when using a seat belt
          extender for the front passenger seat. If the AIRBAG OFF
          indicator light is illuminated, disconnect the extender
          tongue from the seat belt buckle, then reconnect the seat
          belt. Reconnect the seat belt extender after making sure
          the AIRBAG ON indicator light is illuminated. If a seat
          belt extender is used while the AIRBAG OFF indicator
          light is illuminated, the SRS front passenger airbag and
          SRS front passenger knee airbag may not activate
          correctly, which could cause death or serious injury in
          the event of a collision.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Do not put a heavy load in the front
          passenger seatback pocket or attach a seatback table to
          the front passenger seatback.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) Do not put weight on the front
          passenger seat by putting your hands or feet on the front
          passenger seatback from the rear seat.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) Do not let a rear passenger lift the
          front passenger seat with their feet or press on the
          seatback with their legs.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) Do not put objects under the front
          passenger seat.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) Do not recline the front passenger
          seatback so far that it touches the rear seat. This may
          cause the AIRBAG OFF indicator light to illuminate, which
          indicates that the SRS passenger airbags will not deploy
          in the event of a severe accident. If the seatback
          touches the rear seat, return the seatback to a position
          where it does not touch the rear seat.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Keep the front passenger seatback as
          upright as possible when the vehicle is moving. Reclining
          the seatback excessively may lessen the effectiveness of
          the seat belt.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Make sure that the AIRBAG ON
          indicator light is illuminated when an adult sits in the
          front passenger seat. If the AIRBAG OFF indicator light
          is illuminated, ask the passenger to sit properly with
          their back upright and against the seat, with legs
          comfortably extended and to wear the seat belt correctly.
          If the AIRBAG OFF indicator light remains illuminated
          nonetheless, let the passenger sit in the rear seat. When
          it is unavoidable to sit in the front passenger seat, ask
          the passenger to move the seat as far back as possible
          and remain properly seated.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When it is unavoidable to install a
          forward-facing child restraint system on the front
          passenger seat, install the child restraint system on the
          front passenger seat in the proper order.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not kick the front passenger seat
          or subject it to severe impacts. Otherwise, the SRS
          warning light may come on to indicate a malfunction of
          the detection system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Child restraint systems installed on
          the rear seat should not come into contact with the front
          seatbacks.</p>
