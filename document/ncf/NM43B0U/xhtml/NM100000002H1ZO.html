          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) A direct-sensing type tire pressure
          warning system is used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Since tire pressure decreases over
          time, regular adjustments are necessary. When the tire
          pressure warning system detects that the tire inflation
          pressure has dropped lower than a threshold, it will
          illuminate the tire pressure warning light to warn the
          driver.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The 4 tire pressure warning valve
          and transmitters each send tire inflation pressure,
          temperature and ID code information to the tire pressure
          warning ECU and receiver.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The tire pressure warning ECU and
          receiver, which consists of a receiver and an ECU,
          monitors the tire pressure warning valve and transmitters
          to detect low tire pressure in each of the 4 tires.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) The operation of the tire pressure
          warning system includes a warning function, initial check
          function, initialization function and diagnosis function.
          The warning function has 2 types of warning, the normal
          warning and the emergency warning, both of which sound a
          buzzer to inform the driver.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) The tire inflation pressure display
          function is a function that displays the pressure of each
          tire together with the position of the identified tire on
          the multi-information display. The display units can be
          changed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) An automatic ID registration
          function has been provided. This function enables the ID
          of each tire pressure warning valve and transmitter to be
          registered automatically by driving the vehicle for 10 to
          30 minutes after entering ID registration mode with the
          tire pressure warning valve and transmitters installed to
          the wheels. Also, to allow summer and winter tire sets to
          be supported, the registered IDs can be changed for each
          tire set.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) The transmission cycle with which
          the information is sent from a tire pressure warning
          valve and transmitter to the tire pressure warning ECU
          and receiver is determined as follows based on the travel
          mode and the acceleration sensor built into each tire
          pressure warning valve and transmitter. Since the
          acceleration sensor is used only to determine if the
          vehicle is being driven, the value of rotational
          acceleration is not sent to the tire pressure warning ECU
          and receiver.</p>

          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The system is disabled in the
          following conditions: (When the condition becomes normal,
          the system will work properly.)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When all of the tires and wheels
          that have the tire pressure warning valve and
          transmitters registered with the tire pressure warning
          ECU and receiver have not been installed.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When all of the transmitter ID codes
          are not registered with the tire pressure warning ECU and
          receiver.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When the tire pressure is 380 kPa
          (3.9 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>, 55 psi) or more.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) When the transmitter battery is
          depleted. (Battery life: approximately 6.5 years)</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The system may become disabled in
          the following conditions: (When the condition becomes
          normal, the system will work properly.)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When electric devices or facilities
          using similar radio frequencies are nearby.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When a wireless device or other
          equipment operating at a similar frequency is in use in
          the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When a window tint that affects
          radio wave signals is installed.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) When there is a lot of snow or ice
          on the vehicle, in particular, around the wheels or wheel
          housings.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) When non-genuine wheels are
          used.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) When non-genuine tires are used.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) When tire chains are used.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) When aftermarket tire repair sealant
          is used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The tire pressure warning system may
          not function properly if aftermarket tire repair sealant
          has been used to repair a flat tire. If this type of
          sealant has been used, the tire pressure warning valve
          and transmitter should be replaced with a new one after
          repairing or replacing the tire.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The tire pressure warning light may
          illuminate due to natural pressure loss caused by air
          passing through the tires or by changes in tire pressure
          caused by temperature fluctuations. When adjusting tire
          pressure, please be aware of the driving conditions and
          temperature conditions. The tire warning light is prone
          to illuminate especially in late autumn and during
          winter.</p>
