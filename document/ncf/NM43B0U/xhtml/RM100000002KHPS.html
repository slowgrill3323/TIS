            <ul class="hint">
              <li>A contract is required before the digital key
              system can be used. Furthermore, various functions
              may be limited depending on the model of
              smartphone.</li>
              <li>Make sure to operate the digital key system while
              carrying a smart device.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(a) By using a smartphone with the
          dedicated application installed, the vehicle can be
          locked or unlocked remotely via "Bluetooth"
          communication. Also, if the smartphone is placed near the
          console box after entering the vehicle, the engine*1 or
          hybrid system*2 can be started using the push start
          button. Furthermore, a key used by the smartphone
          application can be shared with family, friends,
          colleagues, etc.</p>
          <div class="step2">
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">

            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(b) The vehicle can be used with just a
          smartphone, without carrying the electrical key
          transmitter sub-assembly. Also, a key can be provided or
          deleted without lending a physical key.</p>
          <div class="notice">
            <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
            <ul class="note">
              <li>Before using the digital key system, refer to the
              owner's manual for the method of use and make sure to
              observe all precautions.</li>
              <li>The digital key system may not be able to be used
              in situations such as the following. (For details,
              refer to https://toyota.jp/digital_key/) In this
              case, it is recommended to carry the electrical key
              transmitter sub-assembly.
                <div class="list1">
                  <ul class="note">
                    <li>When the smartphone is malfunctioning</li>
                    <li>When the smartphone and server cannot
                    communicate</li>
                    <li>When the smartphone battery is
                    depleted</li>
                    <li>When the service is temporarily stopped due
                    to maintenance, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(c) It is possible to perform operations
          when the smartphone and vehicle are connected via BLE
          ("Bluetooth" low energy). The BLE connection status can
          be checked using the application screen.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The smart device (owner key) which
          has no restrictions is for the owner of the vehicle, and
          only one smart device (owner key) can be registered to
          and used for each vehicle. Furthermore, the owner key can
          issue a maximum of 7 share keys.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) When using a second smart device for
          the owner or user other than the owner, a share key can
          be registered.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Anybody other than the owner of the
          vehicle can use a share key.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) When the vehicle is to be serviced,
          it is possible for the owner key to register a share key
          for the service employee.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Make sure to use this system in an
          area where the smartphone has an internet connection. A
          notification is provided to the user's smartphone if the
          system is used offline.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) When handling a smart device, make
          sure to follow the user manual for each device maker.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) As the cabin temperature may become
          extremely high, it is dangerous to leave a smart device
          in the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Take sufficient care not to leave
          the smart device in the vehicle due to the risk of
          theft.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) The digital key system cannot be
          used when the battery of the smart device is depleted.
          Make sure to check the battery charge level of the smart
          device when using the digital key system. When going to
          an area where charging is not convenient, make sure to
          also carry the electrical key transmitter
          sub-assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Never operate a smart device when
          driving the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) When taking the vehicle to a dealer
          due to a malfunction of the digital key system, etc.,
          make sure to bring the electrical key transmitter
          sub-assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) Some functions may be limited
          depending on the model of smart device.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) Make sure to refer to the compatible
          smart device list before using a smart device as a
          digital key.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) It is possible to use the digital
          key system when the OS is Android 6.0 or iOS 9.0 or
          higher, and the "Bluetooth" version is 4.2 or higher.</p>
          <p class="step2">(k) Make sure to use the latest version
          of the application on the smart device.</p>
          <p class="step2">(l) The application may stop working due
          to maintenance of the digital key system.</p>
          <p class="step2">(m) The digital key application may
          sometimes connect to the center. It is necessary for the
          customer to incur the fees for all data communication
          performed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(n) If a smart device has been lost, the
          risk of vehicle theft increases significantly. Contact
          your dealer immediately with the electrical key
          transmitter sub-assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(o) When the keyless entry function
          cannot be operated using a digital key, use the following
          methods to lock/unlock the doors.</p>
          <div class="step2">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Use the wireless function of the digital
              key.</li>
              <li>Use the electrical key transmitter
              sub-assembly.</li>
              <li>Operate the smart device near a door pillar.</li>
