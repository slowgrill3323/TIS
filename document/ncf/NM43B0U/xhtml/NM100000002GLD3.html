          id="NM100000002GLD3_z0"></a>
          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The intuitive parking assist system
          uses ultrasonic sensors to detect static objects in front
          of, at the corners or to the rear of the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The intuitive parking assist system
          informs the driver of the approximate distance between
          the ultrasonic sensors and any static objects as well as
          their positions by displaying them on the
          multi-information display in the combination meter
          assembly or radio and display receiver assembly and by
          sounding the meter buzzer.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) A mute function for the meter buzzer
          is provided. When the meter buzzer sounds due to the
          detection of an obstacle, the buzzer can be temporarily
          muted.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The intuitive parking assist is
          supplemental equipment that notifies the driver by buzzer
          and display and distance of stationary objects during
          low-speed driving. [1]</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Precautions to observe during use
          [2]</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) There are some restrictions to the
          detection range and operation speed of the sensor. When
          driving the vehicle in forward or reverse, be sure to
          confirm that the area around the vehicle is safe
          (especially on the sides of the vehicle), use the brakes
          to control the vehicle speed and drive slowly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) If an abnormality is displayed,
          first confirm the status of the sensor. If an abnormality
          is displayed even though there is no ice, snow or dirt,
          the sensor may be operating abnormally. Have it inspected
          by your Toyota dealer.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not install aftermarket
          electrical components (backlit license plates, fog
          lights, fender poles, radio antennas, etc.) in the
          vicinity of the sensor.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Do not modify, disassemble, or paint
          the sensor.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) Always keep the sensor clean, but be
          careful not to scratch or otherwise damage it.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) Contact your Toyota dealer when
          removal and installation or replacement of the front or
          rear bumper or grille is necessary.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) Do not install a license plate
          cover.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) Keep the tires inflated to the
          appropriate pressure.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) In the following situations, a
          sensor abnormality may prevent the equipment from
          operating properly. Have the vehicle inspected by your
          Toyota dealer. [3]</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The detection display is illuminated
          or blinks, or the buzzer sounds when no stationary object
          is detected.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The area around the sensor is struck
          by an object, hit or otherwise subject to a strong
          impact.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The bumper is struck.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Precautions to observe when washing
          the vehicle [4]</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When washing the vehicle in a high
          pressure car washer, do not allow water to make direct
          contact with the sensor area. The sensor may stop
          operating normally if subject to impact from high
          pressure water.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When washing the vehicle in a washer
          that uses steam, do not allow the steam to come too close
          to the sensor area. Steam may cause the sensor to stop
          operating normally.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) In the following situations, turn
          off the parking assist sensor system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The system may not be able to detect
          stationary objects, or may not operate correctly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When the suspension installed to the
          vehicle is not the Toyota genuine one.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When the instructions in items [1]
          through [4] above cannot be followed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Precautions during use</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not allow the speed of the
          vehicle to exceed 10 km/h (6.2 mph).</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The detection range of the sensor is
          limited to the vehicle corners and around the front/rear
          bumpers.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The shape and condition of the
          stationary object may reduce the detection range or
          prevent detection.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) The sensor/camera may be unable to
          detect a stationary object if it is too close to it.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) After a stationary object is
          detected, it may take a short amount of time for the
          indicator to operate and the buzzer to sound. The
          stationary object may approach the non-detection range
          before the indicator operates and the buzzer sounds, even
          when driving at low speeds.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) When playing audio or using the air
          conditioning, sounds such as music or the fan noise may
          make it difficult to hear the buzzer sound.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) Sounds such as buzzers from other
          systems may make it difficult to hear sounds from this
          system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) The buzzer may not sound when the
          meter is malfunctioning.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) The sensor may not be able to detect
          stationary objects in the following situations. Be sure
          to drive carefully.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The sensor/camera is covered by ice,
          snow or dirt (returns to normal when the sensor is
          cleaned).</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The sensor/camera is frozen (returns
          to normal when not frozen).</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The sensor/camera is covered by an
          object such as a hand.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) In blazing heat or freezing
          cold.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) The vehicle is being driven on
          undulating roads, sloped roads, unpaved roads, in tall
          grass or similar conditions.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) The vehicle is close to a source of
          ultrasonic waves, such as a vehicle horn or sensor
          system, motorcycle engine, large vehicle air brakes or
          intuitive parking assist equipment on another
          vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) When heavy rain or water is sprayed
          on the sensor.</p>

          <p class="step3">(10) In inclement weather such as fog,
          snow, or a sandstorm.</p>
          <p class="step3">(11) When there is an undetectable
          object between the vehicle and an object that the system
          would otherwise react to.</p>
          <p class="step3">(12) When a detectable object such as a
          car, motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian, etc. cuts in from
          the side of the vehicle or appears suddenly.</p>
          <p class="step3">(13) When accessories such as a towing
          hook, bumper protector, bumper trim, bicycle carrier,
          snow removal device (snowplow), etc. are installed in the
          vicinity of the sensor.</p>
          <p class="step3">(14) When there are extreme changes to
          vehicle height (nose-up, nose-down)</p>
          <p class="step3">(15) The vehicle handling is unstable
          due to an accident or malfunction.</p>
          <p class="step3">(16) Tire chains, an emergency spare
          tire, or a tire repaired with an emergency puncture
          repair kit are being used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) The sensor may not be able to detect
          the following objects. Be sure to drive carefully.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Thin objects such as wire, fences
          and rope.</p>
