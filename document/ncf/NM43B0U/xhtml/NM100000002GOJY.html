          id="NM100000002GOJY_z0"></a>
          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The following brake control
          functions are provided: Anti-lock Brake System (ABS),
          Electronic Brake force Distribution (EBD), brake assist,
          Traction Control (TRAC), Active Traction Control
          (A-TRAC)*1, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), steering
          cooperative control, trailer sway control, Auto limited
          slip differential (AUTO LSD)*2, hill-start assist
          control, downhill assist control*3, CRAWL*3 and brake
          hold.</p>
          <div class="step2">
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
              <li>*1: 4WD models</li>
              <li>*2: 2WD models</li>
              <li>*3: Models with DAC/CRAWL and MTS switch</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(b) The skid control ECU processes
          signals from sensors and performs brake control.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) A secondary collision brake system
          is used. This system lessens damage from a secondary
          collision by controlling the automatic brakes and stop
          light illumination after a collision occurs.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Multi-terrain select is used. When
          the driver performs a switch operation to select an
          appropriate mode for the road conditions, vehicle control
          switches to the optimal control for the road conditions.
          As a result, optimal driving performance is maintained,
          achieving superior off-road driveability.*</p>
          <div class="step2">
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
              <li>*: Models with DAC/CRAWL and MTS switch</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) ABS</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The ABS system cannot increase the
          performance limit of the tires. Always drive safely and
          be aware of the vehicle speed and distance to other
          vehicles.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Any non-standard components such as
          non-standard tires that are installed may have a negative
          effect on the ABS function.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When braking using ABS, the braking
          distance may be longer than models without ABS in the
          following conditions:</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>When driving on a dirt road or a road covered
              with fresh snow</li>
              <li>When using tire chains</li>
              <li>When driving over a joint in the road
              surface</li>
              <li>When driving on a rough road such as an unpaved
              or stone-paved road</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(b) Brake Assist</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Brake assist cannot increase the
          performance limit of the fundamental brake system. Always
          drive safely and be aware of the vehicle speed and
          distance to other vehicles.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) TRAC, VSC</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The TRAC and VSC systems ensure
          traction and vehicle stability. Do not disable the TRAC
          and VSC functions unless necessary.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The TRAC and VSC systems cannot
          increase the performance limit of the tires. Always drive
          the vehicle carefully in conditions in which drive wheel
          traction or vehicle stability may be lost.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Trailer Sway Control</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Trailer sway control is a part of
          the VSC function. Accordingly, if the VSC OFF mode or VSC
          is not functioning normally, trailer sway control will
          not operate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Trailer sway control will be unable
          to stabilize the vehicle if a trailer is being towed
          which cannot be physically controlled due to the
          influence of the vehicle, road surface, driving
          conditions, etc.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Hill-start Assist Control</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Hill-start assist control is not
          intended to keep the vehicle stationary on a hill for a
          prolonged period. As hill-start assist control only
          prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards for 2 seconds
          after the brake pedal is released, perform start-off
          within this period.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When hill-start assist control is
          operating and the ignition switch is turned off,
          hill-start assist control will be canceled without
          warning.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Hill-start assist control prevents
          the vehicle from rolling backwards by controlling the
          brake force to the 4 wheels. However, the vehicle may not
          remain stationary when on an extremely steep slope or a
          low friction surface such as ice.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Brake Hold</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The brake hold is not for parking
          the vehicle for a long period of time in the same way as
          the parking brake.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) If brake hold control does not
          operate even when the vehicle stops, depress the brake
          pedal again firmly to stop the vehicle. If the vehicle
          still does not stop, confirm the conditions for brake
          hold control to operate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When the ignition switch is turned
          off during brake hold operation, control stops.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) This function may not stop the
          vehicle on steep slopes and slippery roads.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) Multi-terrain Select</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Check that the multi-terrain select
          indicator light is illuminated before driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Multi-terrain select is not intended
          to expand the performance limits of the vehicle.
          Thoroughly check the road conditions and driving route in
          advance, and drive with caution.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The information about each mode that
          can be selected in multi-terrain select is for reference
          only. The mode may not be effective enough depending on
          the road conditions (pitch, road surface friction
          coefficient and undulations). Thoroughly check the road
          conditions before driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Multi-terrain select controls the
          vehicle so that the motive force is maximized to improve
          off-road driveability. Therefore, the fuel economy
          performance may not be as good as when driving without
          multi-terrain select.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) Only use multi-terrain select during
          off-road driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) Using multi-terrain select
          continuously for a long time and applying a high load to
          its related parts may prevent sufficiently effective
          operation. Also, when the brake temperature rises too
          much, the brake control of multi-terrain select stops
          temporarily, and the buzzer sounds continuously and TRAC
          OFF is displayed on the multi-information display to
          inform the driver. In such cases, stop the vehicle
          immediately in a safe location and allow the brake
          related parts to cool sufficiently. When the temperature
          drops after waiting a while, the brake control of
          multi-terrain select becomes available for operation
          again.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) When multi-terrain select operates,
          vibration may be felt from the vehicle body or steering
          wheel, or an operating sound may be heard from inside the
          engine room. This is not a malfunction.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) Downhill Assist Control</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Check that the downhill assist
          control indicator light is illuminated before
          driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) While downhill assist control is
          operating, the slip indicator light blinks and the brake
          lights illuminate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When driving down a steep hill that
          is likely to make downhill assist control operate, use
          the engine brake as well while driving downhill. This
          enables stable driving of the vehicle and reduces the
          load on the brake.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Using downhill assist control
          continuously for a long time and applying a high load to
          its related parts may prevent sufficiently effective
          operation. Also, when the brake temperature rises too
          much, downhill assist control stops temporarily, and the
          buzzer sounds continuously and the downhill assist
          control indicator light blinks to inform the driver. In
          such cases, stop the vehicle immediately in a safe
          location and allow the brake related parts to cool
          sufficiently. When the temperature drops after waiting a
          while, downhill assist control becomes available for
          operation again.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) On extremely steep slopes and
          extremely slippery surfaces such as snow-covered roads,
          it may not be possible to maintain a set vehicle
          speed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) CRAWL</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Check that the CRAWL indicator light
          is illuminated before driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) CRAWL is not intended to expand the
          performance limits of the vehicle. Thoroughly check the
          road conditions and driving route in advance, and drive
          with caution.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When CRAWL control ends for a reason
          other than a CRAWL switch operation, the CRAWL indicator
          changes from illuminated to blinking and the buzzer
          sounds intermittently. In such cases, take appropriate
          measures, such as stopping the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Using CRAWL continuously for a long
          time and applying a high load to its related parts may
          prevent sufficiently effective operation. Also, when the
          brake temperature rises too much, CRAWL stops
          temporarily, and the buzzer sounds continuously and the
          CRAWL indicator light blinks and then turns off to inform
          the driver. In such cases, stop the vehicle immediately
          in a safe location and allow the brake related parts to
          cool sufficiently. When the temperature drops after
          waiting a while, CRAWL becomes available for operation
          again.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) Using CRAWL continuously for long
          time may cause the oil temperature of the automatic
          transmission to rise too much. Continuing to drive under
          such conditions will cause an oil leak from the automatic
          transmission or a malfunction. In such cases, stop the
          vehicle immediately in a safe location and allow the
          automatic transmission to cool sufficiently.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) On extremely steep slopes, very
          rough surfaces such as rocky roads, and extremely
          slippery surfaces such as snow-covered roads, it may not
          be possible to maintain a set vehicle speed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) AUTO LSD</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When operating the VSC OFF switch,
          ensure that the vehicle wheels are not spinning
          freely.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When AUTO LSD is available for
          operation, the AUTO LSD indicator light illuminates.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) While AUTO LSD is operating, the
          slip indicator light in the combination meter blinks.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) When the AUTO LSD control is
          continuously operated for a long time, the temperature of
          the brake actuator increases. If the temperature
          increases too much, the AUTO LSD indicator light will
          blink to notify the driver. AUTO LSD will then be
          temporarily stopped to protect the system. AUTO LSD will
          become available for operation again once the AUTO LSD
          indicator light turns off after a short while. The
          vehicle can be driven normally while this occurs.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) The AUTO LSD applies brakes to the
          driving wheel tires and controls the brake pressure,
          which produces the LSD effect. However, start-off
          performance cannot be ensured on steep slopes or road
          surfaces with extremely low road surface resistance such
          as snow-covered roads.</p>
