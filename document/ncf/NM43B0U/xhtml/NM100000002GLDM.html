          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) A panoramic view monitor system is
          provided which displays a panoramic view of the vehicle
          to assist the driver during parking and low speed
          driving. The panoramic image is created by seamlessly
          combining images from each television camera assembly
          installed to the front, rear, left and right sides of the
          vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) In each mode, the displayed screen
          can be switched and the display area can be changed by
          touching the display screen camera image or button.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The panoramic view monitor provides
          a variety of image display modes to make confirming the
          area around the vehicle possible with driving condition
          assistance such as confirming obstacles when driving
          forward or reversing. These display modes include
          simultaneous display of the panoramic view and the front
          view, rear view, front split view or rear split view,
          display of the BED view to check the rear deck, and
          display of the wide front view or wide rear view.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) This system uses the full-screen
          display on the 14-inch wide display to make it possible
          for the driver to easily confirm the surroundings and
          simultaneously confirm a wide range on a single
          screen.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) A trailer backup guide is provided
          to assist in backing up a trailer. It is enabled by
          pressing the trailer backup guidance switch when a
          trailer is connected. The trailer backup guide has 2
          modes: "Straight Path Assist (SPA)" for reversing a
          trailer straight back without the driver having to grip
          the steering wheel, and "guidance for manual steering
          backup (Guidance mode)" for providing a trailer angle
          (jackknife) warning when reversing a trailer straight
          back and indicating the trailer turning direction on the
          multi-display.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) As the trailer backup guide uses the
          rear camera to detect the trailer and calculate the
          trailer angle, a trailer hitch light is provided to allow
          the driver to use the system at night.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) A function, which automatically
          displays the panoramic view and front view screen when
          the intuitive parking assist system detects a stationary
          object, is used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) A zoom mode, which displays an
          expanded view of the screen displaying the camera image
          by pressing the zoom button in the screen, and a
          panoramic view zoom function, which enlarges panoramic
          view screen images from the left and right corners of the
          vehicle in the traveling direction (forward or backward),
          are provided.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">Do not rely solely upon the panoramic
          view monitor system. As with unequipped models, drive
          carefully while directly confirming the safety of your
          surroundings.</p><img src="../images/Y311928E01.png.html"

          <p class="hint">The illustrations shown are example only.
          The illustrations may differ from the actual vehicle
          screens.</p>
          <p class="step1">MAIN FEATURES</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The panoramic view monitor
          seamlessly combines images from the front, rear, left and
          right television camera assemblies and displays the
          combined images as the panoramic view image. In addition,
          the system helps the driver to confirm conditions around
          the vehicle and to assist in driving at low speeds or
          parked, by simultaneously displaying the panoramic view
          and the front view, the rear view and wide rear view, the
          front split view and rear split view, and displaying the
          BED view, and displaying the wide front view or wide rear
          view which has a wider visual field than normal, on the
          radio and display receiver assembly screen.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The front image (front view and wide
          front view) helps the driver confirm whether it is safe
          to start off at locations with poor visibility, such as
          intersections and T-junctions.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The rear image (rear view and wide
          rear view screen) helps the driver reverse the
          vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The front split view helps the
          driver to confirm the safety of the areas to the sides of
          the vehicle, avoid contact with obstacles on narrow
          roads, and drive close to the shoulder.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) The rear split view helps the driver
          to confirm the safety of the areas to the sides of the
          vehicle and to confirm blind spots when towing a
          trailer.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) The BED view can be used to check
          the load status of the rear deck even when driving.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">The panoramic view monitor system is an
          auxiliary device used to confirm the area around the
          vehicle. Always drive while directly confirming the
          surroundings of the vehicle (particularly the area to the
          rear).</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The see through view and moving view
          combines images from the cameras on the front, rear, and
          both sides of the vehicle into a simulated video display
          of the area surrounding the vehicle. By reducing the size
          of the blind spots from inside the vehicle, it assists in
          confirming the safety of the area around the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">The see through view and moving view
          screens can be displayed when the intuitive parking
          assist is on.</p><img src="../images/Y311940C01.png.html"

                      may hit a person or an object, resulting in
                      an accident. When driving, be sure to check

                      may appear differently when displayed in the

          <p class="step2">(g) Precautions for 3-dimensional
          obstacles</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Guide lines on the monitor are for
          flat surfaces (such as roads, etc.). When protruding
          solid objects (obstacles such as a truck rear deck) or
          solid objects located higher than the road surface (the
          bumper, etc.) are nearby, directly confirm the
          surroundings of the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Since the estimated course lines of
          the panoramic view screen are displayed based on a flat
          road surface, solid objects located higher than the road
          surface (such as the bumper, protruding wall, truck rear
          deck, etc.) may not be displayed on the monitor or their
          actual locations may not be judged. Even if a solid
          object is outside of the estimated course lines and
          appears as if it will not contact the vehicle, the object
          may actually be on the path and the vehicle may contact
          the object.</p><img src="../images/Y312047.png.html"
          border="1" alt=" "> <img src="../images/Y312048.png.html"
          border="1" alt=" ">
          <p class="step3">(3) Since the estimated course lines of
          the rear view and wide rear view screens are displayed
          based on flat roads, the location of solid objects cannot
          be judged. Even if a truck rear deck is outside of the
          estimated course lines and appears as if it will not
          contact the vehicle, the rear deck may actually be
          protruding into the path and the vehicle may contact the
          rear deck.</p><img src="../images/Y312049.png.html"
          border="1" alt=" ">
          <p class="step3">(4) The distance indication as shown on
          the screen varies between 3-dimensional objects such as a
          vehicle and objects on a flat plane such as the road
          surface. As shown in the following illustration, points A
          and C are actually vertically aligned and point B is
          farther away from them. However, the points are displayed
          in order of distance from the vehicle, A, B and C.
          Therefore, the vehicle will come into contact with the
          3-dimensional object if it is backed up to point A on the
          screen.</p><img src="../images/Y312050.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">

          control the speed to keep it within operating parameters
          and to avoid a collision.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) As there is a limit to the degree of
          control performance that this system can provide, do not
          overly rely on this system. The driver is always
          responsible for paying attention to the vehicle's
          surroundings and driving safely. This system does not
          control braking (or steering when in Guidance mode).
          Driver needs to control vehicle speed, control braking,
          (and steering when in Guidance mode,) and stop the
          vehicle to avoid any collision. Failure to follow this
          warning could result in property damage, serious injury
          or death.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The system is designed to operate in
          various weather and lighting conditions and on different
          ground surfaces (asphalt, grass, gravel, etc.), however
          performance can still be affected by various
          environmental factors (e.g. shadow passing over the
          trailer or diminished contrast between trailer and the
          ground leading to trailer detection being lost, etc.) so
          always drive carefully, remain alert and aware of your
          surroundings, and do not overly rely on the system.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) For proper system performance,
          observe the following precautions. Failure to do so may
          lead to an accident resulting in property damage, serious
          injury, or death.</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Keep the tailgate fully latched.</li>
              <li>Keep the rear camera clean at all times.</li>
              <li>Do not change the installation position or
              direction of the rear camera or remove it.</li>
              <li>Do not modify the hitch light.</li>
              <li>Make sure nothing can obstruct the rear camera
              view of the trailer.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step3">(5) The system is designed to support
          most trailers 2m (6.6 ft.) to 8m (26.2 ft.) in length
          (length is defined from the coupler center point for the
          ball to the wheel axle (single axle) or center of the
          wheel axle (2 or more axles)) with ball mount lengths
          between 114.3mm (4.5 in.) and 469.9mm (18.5 in.). Do not
          attempt to use trailers outside of this range as the
          system performance degrades and could cause improper
          system function.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) Icon Display</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The icon of the intuitive parking
          assist system and Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA) is
          displayed superimposed on a view captured by the camera.
          The icon may difficult to see depending on the brightness
          and color of the surroundings.</p><img src="../images/Y312051C01.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">
