          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) To achieve low emissions and
          enhanced fuel economy, the stop and start system has been
          developed.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The stop and start system
          automatically stops the engine when the vehicle comes to
          a stop, such as when the vehicle stops at a red traffic
          light. When starting off, the engine is automatically
          restarted without requiring any extra activity from the
          driver.</p><img src="../images/Y140861E41.png.html"
          border="1" alt=" ">
          <p class="step2">(c) The stop and start system consists
          of an engine stop and start ECU, backup boost converter
          and starter assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Based on signals from various
          sensors, switches, and the ECM, the engine stop and start
          ECU controls the stopping and starting of the engine.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) When the engine is stopped, the ECM
          stores the crankshaft angle. This is used to determine
          which cylinder to inject fuel into and ignite the next
          time the engine is restarted. This shortens the amount of
          time necessary to restart the engine.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) To allow management of the lifespan
          of the starter assembly, the engine stop and start ECU
          counts the number of times the starter operates. If the
          number exceeds a threshold, the ECU blinks the stop and
          start cancel indicator light to inform the driver that a
          replacement is required.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">After the starter assembly has been
          replaced, it is necessary to clear the record of the
          number of times that the starter assembly has been
          operated. For details, refer to the Repair Manual.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) During idling stop, the oil pump
          with solenoid assembly operates to ensure a stable ATF
          pressure, achieving a smooth start off.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) A hill-start assist function is
          provided in order to assist smooth starting on a slope
          while the engine is restarted after idling stop. The skid
          control ECU retains the brake hydraulic pressure until
          sufficient driving force is generated.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) Idle stop is now performed even when
          the vehicle is stopped through the brake hold function.
          As a result, the idle stop time has increased to achieve
          a greater reduction in fuel consumption amount.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) Through the use of the stop and
          start system for a Direct injection 4-stroke gasoline
          engine Superior version (D-4S) engine, the engine restart
          time has been reduced compared to the port injection type
          engine.</p>
          <p class="step2">(k) Operating conditions of the stop and
          start system various advice and warnings are provided
          using the multi-information display, stop and start
          indicator light and stop and start cancel indicator light
          in the combination meter assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(l) Through the use of a high
          performance battery and high-precision battery state
          sensor assembly, the amount of time until the threshold
          value for idle stop prohibition is reached has been
          extended and the idle stop operation permission range has
          been expanded.</p>
          <p class="step2">(m) An operation limit which prohibits
          stop and start system control under certain conditions is
          provided to protect the battery when a non-specified
          battery is used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(n) Stop and start operation time when
          the air conditioning is operating can be changed between
          "Standard" and "Extended (the stop and start system has
          priority)".</p>
