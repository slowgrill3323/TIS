          <p class="step2">(a) Stop and Start System</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) To achieve low emissions and
          enhanced fuel economy, the stop and start system is
          provided.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The stop and start system
          automatically stops the engine when the vehicle comes to
          a stop, such as when the vehicle stops at a red traffic
          light. When starting off, the engine is automatically
          restarted without requiring any extra activity from the
          driver.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Dynamic Radar Cruise Control
          System</p>

          system is provided.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The dynamic radar cruise control
          system is designed to help reduce driver fatigue by
          helping to control the vehicle to a speed chosen by the
          driver. Once the dynamic radar cruise control system is
          set to the desired vehicle speed, the ECM automatically
          regulates the motive force to maintain the set vehicle
          speed without any accelerator pedal operation.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Lane Tracing Assist System</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The lane tracing assist system is
          provided.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) system
          uses a forward recognition camera installed on the top of
          the windshield glass to recognize lane markers when
          driving on highways or controlled-access highways marked
          with lane markers. The LTA system also uses the forward
          recognition camera and millimeter wave radar sensor
          assembly to recognize preceding and surrounding vehicles,
          as well as to provide information to the driver,
          performing steering assistance according to road or
          driving conditions.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Road Sign Assist System</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The Road Sign Assist (RSA) system is
