          and there is a possibility of contact with forward or

          <p class="step2">(a) In Order to Ensure Safe Operation of
          Parking Support Brake System</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not rely solely upon the parking
          support brake system. Doing so can lead to unforeseen
          accidents such as collisions with other vehicles.</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>The driver is responsible for safe operation of
              the vehicle. The driver is responsible for safe
              operation of the vehicle. The parking support brake
              system may be able to reduce the severity of impacts,
              but the system may not function in some
              circumstances.</li>
              <li>The parking support brake system does not
              completely stop the vehicle. Even if the vehicle does
              stop, the brake pedal should be depressed
              immediately, as the system releases the brakes after
              approximately 2 seconds.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(b) Parking Support Brake System
          (Forward or Rearward Stationary Objects, Surrounding
          Stationary Objects) Precautions</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Make sure to observe the following
          precautions regarding the ultrasonic sensor. Failure to
          observe these precautions may result in incorrect
          ultrasonic sensor operation and may lead to an unforeseen
          accident. [1]</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Do not modify, disassemble or paint.</li>
              <li>Do not subject the ultrasonic sensor to
              impacts.</li>
              <li>Always keep ultrasonic sensors clean without
              damaging them.</li>
              <li>Contact the Toyota dealer when removal and
              installation or replacement of the front/rear bumper
              or grille is required.</li>
              <li>Do not install a license plate cover.</li>
              <li>Do not install any commercial accessories
              (backlit license plate, fog light, fender pole,
              wireless antenna, etc.) near sensors.</li>
              <li>Maintain appropriate tire pressure.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step3">(2) Do not modify the vehicle
          suspension. Changing the vehicle height or tilt may
          prevent the ultrasonic sensor from correctly detecting
          stationary objects and may prevent correct operation or
          cause unnecessary operation of the system. [2]</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) An impact applied to the ultrasonic
          sensor may damage the sensor and prevent it from
          operating normally. Have the vehicle inspected by your
          Toyota dealer.[3]</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) When washing the vehicle in a high
          pressure car washer, do not allow water to make direct
          contact with the sensor area. The sensor may stop
          operating normally if subject to impact from high
          pressure water. [4]</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) When washing the vehicle in a washer
          that uses steam, do not allow the steam to come too close
          to the sensor area. Steam may cause the sensor to stop
          operating normally. [5]</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) In the following situations, turn
          off the parking support brake system. The system may
          operate even though there is no possibility of
          collision.</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>When chassis rollers, the chassis dynamometer, or
              free rollers are used for a vehicle inspection.</li>
              <li>When moving while loading onto a ship or
              truck.</li>
              <li>When suspension has been lowered or tire with a
              different diameter than a genuine tire, etc. is
              installed.</li>
              <li>When the vehicle height changes significantly due
              to loading (nose up, nose down, etc.).</li>
              <li>When a towing hook is installed.</li>
              <li>When items [1] through [5] above are not
              followed.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step3">(7) The parking support brake
          (stationary objects) detection range differs from that of
          the intuitive parking assist. As a result, even if the
          intuitive parking assist notifies the driver of an
          stationary object in the vicinity, the parking support
          brake (stationary object) operation may not have
          started.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) The following stationary objects may
          not be detected by the ultrasonic sensor.</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Objects that have difficulty reflecting sound
              waves, such as people, cotton, snow, etc. (some
              people may also not be detected due to their
              clothing).</li>
              <li>Objects that are not perpendicular to the ground
              or the traveling direction of the vehicle, rough or
              wavy objects.</li>
              <li>Short or low to the ground objects.</li>
              <li>Thin objects such as wire, fences, rope and sign
              posts etc.</li>
              <li>Objects extremely close to the bumper.</li>
              <li>Objects with sharp shapes.</li>

          <p class="step3">(1) Make sure to observe the following
          precautions regarding the blind spot monitor sensor.
          Failure to observe these precautions may result in
          incorrect blind spot monitor sensor operation and may
          lead to an unforeseen accident.</p>

              <li>Do not disassemble the blind spot monitor
              sensor.</li>
              <li>Do not install accessories in the blind spot
              monitor sensor and the rear bumper near the blind
              spot monitor sensor and apply any sticker (including
              a transparent one) and aluminum tape.</li>
              <li>Do not modify the blind spot monitor sensor or
              the rear bumper around the blind spot monitor
              sensor.</li>
              <li>Contact the Toyota dealer when removal and
              installation or replacement of the blind spot monitor
              sensor and rear bumper.</li>
              <li>When repairing the paint of the rear bumper, only
              use Toyota genuine colors.</li>

          <p class="step3">(1) The detection range of the parking
          support brake (pedestrians behind vehicle) differs from
          the detection range of the RCD. As a result, even if the
          RCD notifies the driver of a stationary object in the
          vicinity, the parking support brake (pedestrians behind
          vehicle) operation may not have started.</p>
