          <p class="step1">OUTLINE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) An Adaptive Variable Suspension
          system (AVS) is used.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) The AVS controls the damping force
          of the shock absorber according to driving operations and
          road conditions, achieving superior steering response,
          stability (flat and stable drive) and a stable and
          comfortable ride.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The linear solenoid type absorber
          control actuators switch the damping force, achieving
          fine-grained control.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The AVS damping force control system
          consists of vehicle speed sensing control which performs
          control according to driving operations, anti-pitch
          control, roll posture control, repercussion control
          (sprung speed proportional control) which performs
          control according to road conditions, roughness sensing
          control and unsprung damping control.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) The AVS system optimally controls
          the damping force through cooperative control together
          with the brake control system and pre-collision safety
          system.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) A mode switching function is
          provided, which makes it possible to select the damping
          force control mode by performing drive mode select
          operations.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) L4 drive mode control is provided.
          In the L4 drive mode, riding comfort and driving
          performance during off-road driving are ensured by
          optimally controlling the damping force for off-road
          driving.</p>
          <p class="step1">MAIN FEATURES</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The AVS system achieves higher
          levels of flatness and riding comfort by introducing
          "Repercussion Control (sprung speed proportional
          control)" to fully utilize the linear solenoid type
          damping force variable shock absorber. Also, the linear
          solenoid type damping force variable shock absorber
          quickly and smoothly performs fine-grained control to
          switch the damping force. As a result, control is
          performed much more frequently and control of higher
          frequencies is made possible.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Flat feeling in normal range</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The system constantly controls the
          damping force using the characteristics of the linear
          solenoid type damping force variable shock absorber in an
          effort to stop both large and small vehicle movements. As
          a result, the system can ensure a flat vehicle posture
          for most road surfaces and driving
          conditions.</p><img src="../images/X135587E01.png.html"
          border="1" alt=" ">
          <p class="step2">(c) Flat feeling even on complex road
          surfaces</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The system appropriately controls
          the damping force using the characteristics of the linear
          solenoid type damping force variable shock absorber
          during each moment that the vehicle travels over minute
          variations in the road surface. As a result, large
          vehicle movements are suppressed while rough shocks are
          reduced to achieve a flat and smooth riding comfort, even
          on complex road surfaces (general surfaces with large
          unevenness together with minute variations) where
          effective control could not be fully achieved with the
          conventional step motor type.</p><img src="../images/X135588E01.png.html" border="1" alt=" ">
