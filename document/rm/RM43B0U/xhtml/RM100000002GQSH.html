                  <p class="step2">(a) When a terminal contact is loose or damaged or a part is improperly installed, the system may only temporarily return to normal if the part is removed and installed without thorough diagnosis and repair.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(b) In order to assist with diagnosis, check and make a note of related information such as DTCs and Freeze Frame Data before disconnecting any connectors or removing and installing parts.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(c) Since the system may be influenced by malfunctions in systems other than the parking support brake system, be sure to check for any past and present DTCs in other systems.</p>
            
         
         
            
                  <p class="step1">HANDLING PRECAUTIONS FOR ECU OR SENSOR</p>
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(a) Unless specified by the inspection procedure, make sure that the ignition switch off when removing or installing each ECU or ultrasonic sensor.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(b) After removing and installing each ECU or ultrasonic sensor and all parts have been installed, check and ensure that no DTCs are output.</p>
            
         
         
            
                  <p class="step1">HANDLING PRECAUTIONS FOR PARKING SUPPORT BRAKE SYSTEM</p>
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(a) Make sure to observe the following points when using the parking support brake system.</p>
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(1) Do not rely solely upon the parking support brake system. Relying solely upon the parking support brake system may lead to an unexpected accident.</p>
                  
                  <div class="step3">
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                        Driving safely is the sole responsibility of the driver. Pay careful attention to the surrounding conditions in order to ensure safe driving. The parking support brake function can provide support to lessen the severity of collisions. However, it may not operate depending on the situation.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        The parking support brake system is not a system to stop the vehicle completely. If the vehicle is stopped by the parking support brake system, brake control by the parking support brake system will be canceled after approximately 2 seconds. Depress the brake pedal immediately after the parking support brake system operates.
                     </li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(2) For the parking support brake system to operate correctly, make sure to observe the following points for the ultrasonic sensors. If not, the ultrasonic sensors may not operate correctly, resulting a serious injury.</p>
                  
                  <div class="step3">
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                        Do not modify, disassemble or paint an ultrasonic sensor.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        When replacing an ultrasonic sensor, only use LEXUS genuine parts.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not subject an ultrasonic sensor or the area around an ultrasonic sensor to any impact.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not damage an ultrasonic sensor. Always keep the ultrasonic sensors clean.

                  <p class="step3">(3) Adhere to the following precautions for the blind spot monitor sensor to ensure that the system operates normally. If the blind spot monitor sensor does not operate normally, it may lead to an unforeseen accident, which is dangerous.</p>
                  
                  <div class="step3">
                     <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                        Keep the blind spot monitor sensors and the surrounding areas on the rear bumper clean at all times.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not subject a blind spot monitor sensor or its surrounding area on the rear bumper to a strong impact. If a blind spot monitor sensor is moved even slightly off position, the system may malfunction and vehicles may not be detected correctly. In the following situations, inspect the blind spot monitor sensor and surrounding area.
                     <div class="list1">
                              <ul class="list">

                           A blind spot monitor sensor or its surrounding area is subject to a strong impact.
                        </li>
                                 <li>
                           If the surrounding area of a blind spot monitor sensor is scratched or dented, or part of them has become disconnected.
                        </li>
                              </ul>
                           </div>

                        <li>
                        Do not disassemble the blind spot monitor sensor.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not install accessories in the blind spot monitor sensors and the rear bumper near the blind spot monitor sensors and apply any sticker (including a transparent one) and aluminum tape.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not modify the blind spot monitor sensor or surrounding area on the rear bumper.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not paint the rear bumper any color other than an official LEXUS color.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not drop a blind spot monitor sensor or subject it to a strong impact, as it is a high-precision device.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        Do not reuse a blind spot monitor sensor that has been dropped or subjected to a strong impact.
                     </li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(4) Do not modify the suspension, as changes to the height or incline of the vehicle may prevent the ultrasonic sensors from correctly detecting obstacles. This may cause the system to fail to operate or to operate incorrectly.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(5) If the area around an ultrasonic sensor is subjected to an impact, equipment may not operate properly due to an ultrasonic sensor malfunction.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(6) When washing the vehicle with a high-pressure washer, do not spray water on the ultrasonic sensors or surrounding areas. High-pressure water can damage the ultrasonic sensors.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(7) When using steam to wash the vehicle, do not apply steam too close to the ultrasonic sensors. They may not function properly if subjected to steam.</p>
