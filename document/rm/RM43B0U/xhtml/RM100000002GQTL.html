                  <p class="step2">(a) In the following situations, the panoramic view monitor system may not operate correctly:</p>
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(1) When driving on icy, slippery or snowy roads</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(2) When using tire chains or a spare tire</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(3) When a door is not fully closed</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(4) When driving on a slope or rough roads</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(5) When using tires other than specified</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(6) When the suspension of the vehicle has been modified</p>
               
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(b) As the panoramic view monitor system generates the panoramic image by combining images received from the front television camera assembly, rear television camera assembly and side camera assemblies, the following phenomenon may occur:</p>
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(1) A three dimensional object may appear tilted.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(2) An object above the road surface may appear farther away than it actually is, or may not be displayed at all.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(3) A tall object may look as if it is coming out from between 2 combined images.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(4) Depending on the brightness of the area surrounding each camera, there may be a significant difference in the brightness of the images that are used to generate the panoramic image.</p>
               
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(c) The image quality at the four corners of the panoramic image may be low as this is where the individual images are combined.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(d) Objects a certain height above the camera assemblies will not be displayed.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(e) Objects extremely close to the vehicle may not be displayed on the panoramic view monitor.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(f) The panoramic image may not be displayed correctly if a front door or the back door is open.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(g) The panoramic image may not be displayed correctly if the height or inclination of the vehicle changes due to loading from passengers, luggage, etc.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(h) As the size and shape of the vehicle icon may differ from that of the actual vehicle, the position of an object relative to the vehicle icon may appear different to its actual position.</p>
            
         
         
            
                  <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR TRAILER BACKUP GUIDE FUNCTION</p>
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(a) In the following situations, the trailer backup guide function may not operate correctly:</p>
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(1) The rear No. 2 television camera assembly is not transmitting a clear image</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(2) When the vehicle stability control system or antilock brake system is activated</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(3) When the electronic power steering system malfunction has occurred</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(4) When the system is in straight path assist mode, and there is excessive vehicle speed, steering torque, or steering rate. Steering control will be canceled and the system will notify the driver through meter indication (message and buzzer).</p>
               
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(b) Trailer backup guide function is designed to support trailers with single or multi-axles using a ball hitch. Trailer backup guide function does not support fifth wheel or gooseneck trailers.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(c) Trailer backup guide function covers trailers 2000 mm (6.56 ft.) to 8000 mm (26.2 ft.) in length  (length is defined as the coupler center point for the ball  to the wheel axle) with ball mount lengths between 4.5 in. and 18.5 in.</p>
            
            
               
                  <p class="step2">(d) Trailer backup guide function covers various trailer tongue types (straight beam, A-frame, etc.) with add-ons   (weight distribution hitches and/or aftermarket accessories, such as coolers, propane tanks, etc.)</p>

                  <p class="step2">(a) Notes for each television camera assembly</p>
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(1) The panoramic view monitor system may not function properly if subjected to a severe blow by any hard object.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(2) Do not scrub the cover part of the camera (resin made). Scrubbing may scratch the cover and affect the image. Prevent organic solvents, waxes, bond removing solvents or glass coating from adhering to the cover. If such material adheres to the cover, clean it off immediately and wash it with water.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(3) Exposing the camera to a sudden temperature change may affect proper functioning of the camera.</p>
               
               
                  
                  <p class="step3">(4) A clear image may not appear if the camera is dirty with snow, mud, etc. In that case, wash it with water and wipe off the lens. Use a detergent to remove dirt if necessary.</p>
