          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR REFRIGERANT HFO-1234yf
          (R1234yf)</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Compatibility</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The parts used in the refrigerant
          cycle, the compressor oil, etc. of an HFO-1234yf
          (R1234yf) system are not compatible with a conventional
          HFC-134a (R134a) system.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) Refrigerant</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Always use HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) as
          the refrigerant.</p>
          <div class="warning">
            <p class="warngen">CAUTION:</p>
            <ul class="warn">
              <li>Do not charge the system with refrigerant near
              open flame, as HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) is
              combustible.</li>
              <li>When charging the system with refrigerant, make
              sure that the area is well ventilated (especially be
              careful in areas where the gas can easily accumulate,
              such as under lifts and in garage pits, as the gas is
              heavier than air).</li>
              <li>Follow any local regulations regarding
              combustible gases.</li>
              <li>Be sure to use a refrigerant recovery unit that
              is compatible with HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems.</li>
              <li>High pressure gas is used for the air
              conditioning system. Be sure to follow the procedure
              described in the repair manual.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">The shape of the service port for
          refrigerant charging has an exclusive design conforming
          to international standards for HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) to
          prevent improper refrigerant charging.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Compressor Oil (except Gasoline
          Model)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Always use ND-OIL 11 as the
          compressor oil.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">The oil used for HFC-134a (R134a) systems
          (ND-OIL 8) does not work well in HFO-1234yf (R1234yf)
          systems. If the oil used for HFC-134a (R134a) systems
          (ND-OIL 8) is used in an HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) system, it
          will result in degradation of the refrigerant and
          deterioration of resin parts.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When parts of the air conditioning
          system are removed, quickly block off any areas that are
          exposed to the outside air with plugs, vinyl tape, etc.,
          as the oil used for HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems absorbs
          moisture easily.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not allow the compressor oil to
          spray, as the oil used for HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems
          has harmful effects on acrylic resins.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Compressor Oil (for Gasoline
          Model)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Always use ND-OIL 12 as the
          compressor oil.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">The oil used for HFC-134a (R134a) systems
          (ND-OIL 8) does not work well in HFO-1234yf (R1234yf)
          systems. If the oil used for HFC-134a (R134a) systems
          (ND-OIL 8) is used in an HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) system, it
          will result in degradation of the refrigerant and
          deterioration of resin parts.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When parts of the air conditioning
          system are removed, quickly block off any areas that are
          exposed to the outside air with plugs, vinyl tape, etc.,
          as the oil used for HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems absorbs
          moisture easily.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not allow the compressor oil to
          spray, as the oil used for HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems
          has harmful effects on acrylic resins.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Evacuation</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When evacuating the system, be sure
          to use a refrigerant recovery unit, refrigerant recycler
          and refrigerant charger that are compatible with
          HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Refrigerant Gas Leak Inspection</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Use a gas leak detector to check for
          refrigerant gas leaks.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">Be sure to use a gas leak detector that
          is compatible with HFO-1234yf (R1234yf) systems.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Turn the ignition switch off when
          checking for refrigerant leaks.</p>
          <div class="hint">
            <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
            <ul class="hint">
              <li>If the engine is running when checking for leaks,
              the leaking gas will be diluted by the air from the
              fan and blower and detection will be more
              difficult.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="hint">
            <ul class="hint">
              <li>If the air conditioning system is operating when
              checking for leaks, the refrigerant pressure in the
              system will decrease, making it harder for gas to
              leak.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="hint">
            <ul class="hint">
              <li>If the air conditioning system is operating when
              checking for leaks, an electronic gas leak detector
              may react to a sudden change in humidity due to the
              humid air from the drain hose and a faulty judgment
              will be made.</li>
            </ul>

          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS RELATED TO REMOVAL AND
          INSTALLATION OF PARTS</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) In case refrigerant gets in your
          eyes</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not rub your eyes with your hands
          or a cloth.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Consult an eye doctor.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Handling of Refrigerant
          (Container)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not heat the container. If the
          container is directly heated or put into boiling water,
          the pressure inside the container will become abnormally
          high and the container may burst.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Do not drop or strike the
          container.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not bring the container anywhere
          near your face. Always wear eye protection.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Pipe Installation (except Gasoline
          Model)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Always use new O-rings.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">When removing an O-ring, use an object
          with a soft tip so as not to damage the piping.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Apply a sufficient amount of
          compressor oil (ND-OIL 11) to the O-ring.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Route the hoses in the way they are
          naturally shaped. Do not twist or forcibly bend the
          hoses.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Do not use cloth gloves, etc. as
          fibers attached to O-rings can lead to refrigerant gas
          leaks.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Pipe Installation (for Gasoline
          Model)</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Always use new O-rings.</p>
