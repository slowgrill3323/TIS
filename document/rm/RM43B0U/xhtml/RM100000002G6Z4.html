          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Before disassembling the transfer
          assembly, clean the outside and remove any sand, mud or
          other foreign matter to prevent it from entering the
          transfer assembly during disassembly and
          installation.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) When disassembling the connecting
          parts of light alloy parts such as the transfer case, do
          not pry them off with a screwdriver or other tool.
          Instead, tap the parts with a plastic-faced hammer.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Disassembled parts should be
          arranged in the order they were removed and protected
          from dust, etc.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Before installation, thoroughly
          clean and dry each part, and then apply transfer gear oil
          LF to required locations.</p>
          <p class="step2p">Do not clean aluminum parts or rubber
          parts with alkaline chemicals.</p>
          <p class="step2p">Also, do not clean rubber parts such as
          O-rings and oil seals with wash oil such as non-residue
          solvent.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Apply a sufficient amount of
          transfer gear oil LF to sliding surfaces and rotating
          parts before installation.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) When securing a part in a vise, be
          sure to place an aluminum plate between the part and
          vise. Do not secure the part directly in the vise.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) Be careful not to damage the contact
          surfaces of the case. Such damage may cause oil
          leaks.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) Before applying seal packing 1281,
          fully remove any old sealant remaining on the part to be
          sealed and clean the part to be sealed with non-residue
          solvent.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) Do not add oil soon after installing
          the sealed part. Leave for 1 hour or more.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) Be careful not to damage the contact
          surfaces of oil seals, O-rings or gaskets. Such damage
          may cause oil leaks.</p>
          <p class="step2">(k) When press-fitting oil seals, make
          sure not to damage the lip or outside edge of the oil
          seal.</p>
          <p class="step2">(l) Replace damaged or deformed snap
          rings with new ones.</p>
          <p class="step2">(m) Unless otherwise specified in the
          inspection procedure, be sure to turn the ignition switch
          off before removing or installing the 4 wheel drive
          control ECU, switches or other parts.</p>
          <p class="step2">(n) When the 4 wheel drive control ECU,
          switches or any other part is removed and installed, be
          sure to check for DTCs. If the DTCs are not normal, clear
          the DTCs and check that abnormal codes have been restored
          to normal.</p>
          <p class="step1">TROUBLESHOOTING PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) In order to determine the
          malfunctioning area, be sure to check the conditions at
          the time the malfunction occurred, such as by DTC output,
          and record them before disconnecting each connector or
          removing and installing parts.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) When there is a malfunction in the
          contact point of the terminals or installation problems
          with parts, removal and installation of the suspected
          problem parts may return the system to the normal
          condition either completely or temporarily.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Since the transfer system may be
          influenced by a malfunction in other systems, be sure to
          check for DTCs in the other systems.</p>
          <p class="step1">CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The CAN communication system is used
          for data communication between each of the ECUs and
          sensors. If there is trouble in the CAN communication
          line, a CAN communication line DTC is output.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) If a CAN communication line DTC is
          output, repair the malfunction in the communication line
          and troubleshoot the touch select 2-4 and high-low
          system.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Since the CAN communication line has
          its own length and route, it cannot be repaired
          temporarily with a bypass wire, etc.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR REPLACEMENT OF 4 WHEEL
          DRIVE CONTROL ECU</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) When the 4 wheel drive control ECU
          is replaced, update the ECU security key.</p>
