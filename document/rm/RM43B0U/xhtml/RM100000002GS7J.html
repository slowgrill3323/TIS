          without the spiral cable sub-assembly installed in the
          neutral position, the cable may break.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION FOR AIRBAG ECU ASSEMBLY AND
          AIRBAG SENSORS</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) When the airbags and pretensioners
          are deployed (including when only an airbag or
          pretensioner is deployed) due to a collision, be sure to
          replace all sensors in the damaged areas (anywhere in
          need of repair) and the airbag ECU assembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Visually check the airbag sensors in
          undamaged areas for defects.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The defects are as follows:</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Cracks in the sensor housing</li>
              <li>Dents in the sensor housing</li>
              <li>Chips in the sensor housing</li>
              <li>Cracks or other damage to the connector</li>

          airbag ECU assembly, front airbag sensor, side airbag
          pressure sensor, floor side airbag sensor and No. 2 side
          airbag sensor assembly connectors, be sure to perform
          work with the sensors installed to the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Do not use a sensor if dropped
          during operation.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Do not use a sensor if subjected to
          any strong impact.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Never disassemble any of the SRS
          parts.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION FOR SIDE AIRBAG PRESSURE
          SENSOR</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Do not make any modifications to the
          front door that may change the inner pressure of the
          front door.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Do not allow any foreign matter to
          enter the side airbag pressure sensor as it may affect
          the pressure detection performance of the sensor.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) When painting the front door, remove
          or apply protective tape to the side airbag pressure
          sensor to prevent paint from attaching to it.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Make sure that the parts which
          maintain the sealing performance of the front door are
          securely installed. If the sealing performance of the
          front door decreases, the pressure detection performance
          of the side airbag pressure sensor may be affected.
          Repair or replace parts as necessary.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION FOR WIRE HARNESS AND
          CONNECTOR</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) All wire harnesses except unexposed
          harnesses in the motor compartment are colored
          yellow.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) As special connectors are used, be
          careful when handling them.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION FOR DAMAGED VEHICLE</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Before using an electric welder on
          the vehicle, remove any airbags and pretensioners around
          the area being repaired.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Before repairs, remove the airbag
          ECU assemblies if impacts are likely to be applied to the
          sensor during repairs.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Never expose an airbag sensor
          directly to high temperatures.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) As the airbags and pretensioners are
          very hot after being deployed, ensure that all wire
          harnesses and connectors around deployed SRS parts are
          not damaged.</p>
