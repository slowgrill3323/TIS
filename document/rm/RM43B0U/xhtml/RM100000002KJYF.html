          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Before disassembling the
          differential assembly, thoroughly clean it by removing
          any sand, mud or foreign matter. This will help prevent
          contamination during disassembly and reassembly.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) When removing the rear differential
          carrier cover or any other light alloy part, do not pry
          it off with a screwdriver or other tool that may cause
          damage. Instead, tap the part with a plastic-faced
          hammer.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Always arrange disassembled parts in
          the order they were removed and protect them from foreign
          matter.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Before installation of each part,
          thoroughly clean and dry it. Then apply hypoid gear oil
          to it. Do not use alkaline chemicals to clean aluminum
          parts, rubber parts or ring gear set bolts. Also, do not
          use non-residue solvent or other cleaning oils to clean
          O-rings, oil seals or rubber parts.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) Coat sliding surfaces and rotating
          parts with hypoid gear oil.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) Do not directly fix a part in a
          vise. Place aluminum plates between the part and
          vise.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) Be careful not to damage the contact
          surfaces of the case. Such damage may cause oil
          leakage.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) Before applying sealant, remove
          deposited oil sealant and clean the part to be sealed
          using non-residue solvent.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) After sealing parts, do not allow
          oil to contact the seal for at least an hour.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) Do not allow scratches on a part's
          contact surface with an oil seal, O-ring or gasket.
          Scratches may lead to oil leakage.</p>
          <p class="step2">(k) When press-fitting an oil seal, be
          careful not to damage the lip of the oil seal and its
          outside periphery.</p>
          <p class="step2">(l) When replacing a bearing, replace
          the inner and outer races as a set.</p>
          <p class="step2">(m) When replacing a differential case,
          replace the differential case RH and differential case LH
          as a set.</p>
          <p class="step2">(n) In the bearing mounting process
          after each preload measurement and tooth contact
          inspection, the bearing can be reused only if the bearing
          is new, if the bearing is not scratched or damaged, and
          if hypoid gear oil is not attached.</p>
          <p class="step2">(o) Unless otherwise specified in the
          inspection procedure, be sure to turn the ignition switch
          off before removing or installing the 4 wheel drive
          control ECU, switches or other parts.</p>
          <p class="step2">(p) When the 4 wheel drive control ECU,
          switches or any other part is removed and installed, be
          sure to check for DTCs. If the DTCs are not normal, clear
          the DTCs and check that abnormal codes have been restored
          to normal.</p>
          <p class="step1">TROUBLESHOOTING PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) In order to determine the
          malfunctioning area, be sure to check the conditions at
          the time the malfunction occurred, such as by DTC output,
          and record them before disconnecting each connector or
          removing and installing parts.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) When there is a malfunction in the
          contact point of the terminals or installation problems
          with parts, removal and installation of the suspected
          problem parts may return the system to the normal
          condition either completely or temporarily.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Since the differential system may be
          influenced by a malfunction in other systems, be sure to
          check for DTCs in the other systems.</p>
          <p class="step1">CAN COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PRECAUTION</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The CAN communication system is used
          for data communication between each of the ECUs and
          sensors. If there is trouble in the CAN communication
          line, a CAN communication line DTC is output.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) If a CAN communication line DTC is
          output, repair the malfunction in the communication line
          and troubleshoot the differential system.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Since the CAN communication line has
          its own length and route, it cannot be repaired
          temporarily with a bypass wire, etc.</p>
          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR REPLACEMENT OF 4 WHEEL
          DRIVE CONTROL ECU</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) When the 4 wheel drive control ECU
          is replaced, update the ECU security key.</p>
