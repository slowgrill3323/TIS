                  If the auxiliary battery is connected, the parking brake will operate when the brake warning switch assembly (electric parking brake switch assembly) is pulled to the lock side even if the ignition switch is off. Do not operate the electric parking brake switch assembly with the auxiliary battery connected unless specified in the repair manual.

                        <li>
                  To prevent the electric parking brake system from operating, make sure that the shift-linked function is disabled.

                        <li>
                  The electric parking brake may still operate for 20 seconds* after the ignition switch is turned off.

                     *: The electric parking brake may still operate up to 60 minutes depending on the state of the vehicle after the ignition switch is turned off, so be sure to perform the work procedures with the vehicle on a level surface.

                  If any part is removed and installed, check for DTCs to make sure that the normal system code is output after all parts are installed.

                        <li>
                  Replacing a part with a part which does not meet the same specifications may affect the performance of the brake system or lead to a hazardous situation. When replacing a part, always use a part with the same part number or equivalent.
               </li>
                        <li>
                  When servicing the brake system, keep the parts and areas around the parts clean.

                        <li>
                  If the vehicle is equipped with a mobile communication system, make sure to read the related precautions in Introduction.
