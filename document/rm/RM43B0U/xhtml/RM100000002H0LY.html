          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR FRONT CAMERA SYSTEM</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Features of forward recognition
          camera</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The forward recognition camera has
          characteristics similar to those of human eyes. When the
          visibility is poor for the driver, the forward
          recognition camera may not properly detect lane markers
          or vehicles and objects on the road ahead.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Only the objects in the forward
          recognition camera detection area can be detected.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The forward recognition camera has a
          function to detect foreign matter in the area in front of
          the forward recognition camera.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">The forward recognition camera may not
          always detect dirt in the area in front of the forward
          recognition camera.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Toyota Safety Sense is designed to
          operate under the assumption that the driver will drive
          safely, and is designed to help reduce the impact to the
          occupants and the vehicle in the case of a collision or
          assist the driver in normal driving conditions. As there
          is a limit to the degree of recognition accuracy and
          control performance that this system can provide, do not
          overly rely on this system. The driver is always
          responsible for paying attention to the vehicle's
          surroundings and driving safely.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Do not rely solely on the system,
          and drive safely by always paying careful attention to
          your surroundings. This system is not designed to operate
          under all circumstances, and its assistance may be
          limited. Entrusting your safety to or relying on the
          system while you are driving could lead to an unexpected
          accident, resulting in death or serious injury.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) Warning messages and buzzers are
          used to indicate a system malfunction or to inform the
          driver of the need for caution while driving. If a
          warning message is shown on the multi-information
          display, read the message and follow the
          instructions.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) The warning buzzer may be difficult
          to hear due to external noise, audio playback, etc. Also,
          it may be difficult to feel operation of the system due
          to the road conditions, etc.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) In the following situations, the
          sensor does not operate properly, potentially causing the
          individual systems of Toyota Safety Sense to
          malfunction.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When the vehicle is modified to
          change its height or inclination</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When the windshield is dirty,
          fogged, cracked or broken</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) When the outside air temperature is
          high or low</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) When the sensor has dirt, rain
          drops, snow, an insect, dust or other foreign matter
          attached to its front</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) When driving in inclement weather
          such as heavy rain, fog, snow or a sandstorm</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) When there is a cloud of water,
          snow, dust, etc., water vapor or smoke ahead of the
          vehicle</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) When the headlights are not
          illuminated while driving in the dark, such as at night
          or when in a tunnel</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) When a headlight is dim due to its
          lens being dirty</p>
          <p class="step3">(9) When the axis of the headlights is
          not adjusted properly</p>
          <p class="step3">(10) When the headlights are
          malfunctioning</p>
          <p class="step3">(11) When the headlights of an oncoming
          vehicle, sunlight, reflected light, etc. are shining
          directly into the forward recognition camera</p>
          <p class="step3">(12) The surrounding brightness changes
          suddenly</p>
          <p class="step3">(13) When driving near a TV tower,
          broadcasting station, electric power plant, radar
          equipped vehicles, etc., or other location where strong
          radio waves or electrical noise may be present</p>
          <p class="step3">(14) When a wiper blade is obstructing
          the field of view of a sensor</p>
          <p class="step3">(15) When in a location or near objects
          which strongly reflect radio waves, such as the
          following:</p>

            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step3">(16) When near a step or protrusion</p>
          <p class="step3">(17) If a vehicle ahead is narrow, such
          as a personal mobility vehicle</p>
          <p class="step3">(18) If a vehicle ahead has a small
          front or rear end, such as an unloaded truck</p>
          <p class="step3">(19) If a vehicle ahead has a low front
          or rear end, such as a low bed trailer</p>

          CONTROL</p>
          <p class="step1p">Keep in mind the following points when
          servicing vehicles equipped with the dynamic radar cruise
          control.</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) The dynamic radar cruise control is
          designed to be used when driving on highways and
          freeways. As the system may not operate correctly when
          driving on roads used by pedestrians and bicycles, do not
          use dynamic radar cruise control on roads used by
          pedestrians and bicycles as an accident may result.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Do not overly rely on the dynamic
          radar cruise control.</p>
          <div class="step2">
            <ul class="list">
              <li>The dynamic radar cruise control is designed to
              assist in maintaining an appropriate distance with
              the preceding vehicle, however, the system alone is
              not sufficient. Pay constant attention to the
              vehicle-to-vehicle distance and the traffic
              conditions when using the dynamic radar cruise
              control and decelerate with the brake pedal or
              accelerate with the accelerator pedal according to
              the situation to keep an appropriate distance with
              the preceding vehicle.</li>
              <li>The dynamic radar cruise control applies brakes
              as necessary, however, there is a limitation on the
              deceleration control capability. When the preceding
              vehicle decelerates rapidly or another vehicle moves
              in front of the vehicle, decelerating in time to
              avoid a collision may not be possible without
              additional braking.</li>
              <li>The dynamic radar cruise control judges whether
              the distance between the vehicle and the preceding
              vehicle is appropriate. It makes no other judgments.
              It is necessary for the driver to judge risks for
              safety.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="step2">(c) Set the speed appropriately
          according to the speed limit, traffic flow, road
          conditions, weather conditions, etc.</p>
          <p class="step2">(d) The dynamic radar cruise control may
          not operate or give a vehicle approach warning for
          vehicles which are stopped or driving in front at
          significantly slower speeds.</p>
          <p class="step2">(e) When following another vehicle with
          vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode controlling
          vehicle speed, the vehicle will not accelerate if the
          +RES switch is pushed, as the speed is controlled in
          accordance with the speed of the preceding vehicle.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">If the set vehicle speed is increased by
          pushing the +RES switch, the vehicle will accelerate to
          the newly set speed when the preceding vehicle moves out
          of the lane.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">The set vehicle speed can be confirmed on
          the multi-information display.</p>
          <p class="step2">(f) The actual vehicle-to-vehicle
          distance may be shorter than the set vehicle-to-vehicle
          distance when driving on a downhill road.</p>
          <p class="step2">(g) When a system malfunction is
          detected, a warning message is displayed on the
          multi-information display in the combination meter
          assembly and the buzzer sounds.</p>
          <p class="step2">(h) Do not place any objects on top of
          the instrument panel.</p>
          <p class="hintgen">HINT:</p>
          <p class="hint">If an object is reflecting off of the
          windshield glass, the performance of the forward
          recognition camera may decrease.</p>
          <p class="step2">(i) The vehicle approach warning buzzer
          does not sound when constant speed control mode is
          controlling vehicle speed because the presence of and
          distance to the preceding vehicle is not calculated.</p>
          <p class="step2">(j) As the controls performed by
          constant speed control mode and vehicle-to-vehicle
          distance control mode are different, always confirm which
          mode is selected before operating the dynamic radar
          cruise control.</p>
          <p class="step2">(k) When operating the turn signal when
          in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode, the distance
          to the preceding vehicle may reduce as part of
          preparation to change lanes.</p>
          <p class="step2">(l) Do not use the dynamic radar cruise
          control in the following situations, as proper control
          may not be performed, resulting in an unexpected accident
          that may cause serious injury or death.</p>

          <p class="step1">PRECAUTIONS FOR LANE TRACING ASSIST</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Precautions for Using the Lane
          Tracing Assist</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The lane tracing assist provides
          information to the driver and performs steering
          assistance according to the road and driving conditions.
          The driver must keep their hands on the steering wheel
          when the system is operating. The driver must not overly
          rely on the system, and is always responsible for paying
          attention to the vehicle's surroundings and driving
          safely.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When driving on a well maintained
          road with the dynamic radar cruise control operating,
          lane lines and preceding and surrounding vehicles are
          detected using the forward recognition camera and
          millimeter wave radar sensor assembly, and necessary
          steering wheel operation assistance is provided to keep
          the vehicle within the lane. Therefore, the system does
          not operate when lane lines or preceding vehicles are not
          detected. Additionally, if lane lines and preceding and
          surrounding vehicles cannot be detected correctly,
          steering assist force may be applied or a warning buzzer
          may sound unnecessarily. Be sure to control the vehicle
          using the steering wheel in a responsible manner under
          all circumstances even when the system is operating.
          However, only a light amount of steering assist force
          that will not interfere with driving will be applied.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The lane tracing assist is designed
          for use on highways and freeways. Do not use the lane
          tracing assist on other roads.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) The lane centering function uses the
          path of the preceding vehicle to help the driver stay
          within the lane, when traffic, etc. makes it difficult or
          impossible to detect lane markers. If the preceding
          vehicle is being driven extremely close to the left or
          right side of the lane, or changes lanes, the vehicle may
          follow, possibly departing the lane. If the preceding
          vehicle is swaying, the vehicle may also begin swaying or
          depart from the lane.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) If a malfunction is detected, the
          system notifies the driver using buzzer and warning
          message and cancels operation. However, the vehicle can
          continue to be driven normally.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) In order to prevent unintended
          operation, when not using the lane tracing assist, turn
          it off with the LTA main switch.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) Even if the lane departure alert is
          set to vibrate, the buzzer warns the driver when the lane
          tracing assist is operating.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) When a steering operation equivalent
          to a lane change is detected, the system does not
          determine that the vehicle has deviated from the lane and
          the warning system does not operate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(9) The lane tracing assist will not
          operate if Steering Sensor Zero Point Calibration has not
          been completed.</p>
          <p class="step3">(10) In the following situations, the
          function may not operate correctly and the vehicle may
          deviate from the lane.</p>
          <div class="step3">
            <ul class="list">

              <li>When a preceding/nearby vehicle is swaying (Due

          <p class="step1">PRECAUTION FOR LANE DEPARTURE ALERT</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Precautions when handling the lane
          departure alert</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) The lane departure alert provides
          the driver with information and steering assist in
          accordance with the shape of the road and the driving
          conditions of the driver. When the system is operating,
          hands-off driving is not possible. Do not rely on the
          system, and always pay attention to the surrounding
          conditions and the direction the vehicle is heading. It
          is the responsibility of the driver to operate the
          vehicle under any circumstances.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) The lane departure alert operates by
          recognizing lane lines and a course using the forward
          recognition camera. If lane lines or a course cannot be
          recognized, the system will not operate. Additionally, if
          lane lines and a course cannot be detected correctly,
          unnecessary steering assist force or a warning buzzer may
          be applied. Be sure to control the vehicle using the
          steering wheel in a responsible manner under all
          circumstances even when the system is operating. However,
          only a light amount of steering assist force that will
          not interfere with driving will be applied.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) The lane departure warning and lane
          departure prevention functions operate when the LDA
          customization is turned on and when lane lines or a
          course are detected while the vehicle speed is at or
          above the system operating speed. However, depending on
          road conditions and the driving conditions of the driver,
          the system may not operate or operation may be
          canceled.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Depending on the vehicle speed, road
          surface conditions, lane departure angle, etc., the lane
          departure alert or the prevention function may not
          operate or it may be difficult to recognize that it has
          operated.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) If the system detects any
          abnormality, it warns the driver using the buzzer and
          multi-information display, and the system is stopped.
          However, this does not affect normal driving.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) Depending on the situation, the
          warning buzzer may sound even if steering wheel vibration
          is selected.</p>
          <p class="step3">(7) If the lane is not clearly visible,
          or if the lane is not straight, the lane departure
          warning and lane departure prevention functions may not
          operate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(8) The lane departure alert will not
          operate if Steering Sensor Zero Point Calibration has not
          been completed.</p>
          <p class="step3">(9) If it is judged that a pedestrian or
          a parked vehicle is intentionally avoided, the lane
          departure warning and lane departure prevention functions
          may not operate.</p>
          <p class="step3">(10) In some instances, it is not
          possible to determine the possibility of a collision with
          a vehicle driving in the lane next to the vehicle.</p>
          <p class="step3">(11) In the following situations, each
          function may not operate correctly and the vehicle may
          deviate from the lane. The driver is always responsible
          for monitoring the surrounding conditions and not relying
          on this function to correct the path by operating the
          steering wheel.</p>

          operations so that the vehicle does not approach too
          close to the target. However, the range of assistance is
          limited. The driver needs to perform brake and steering
          operations as needed. Do not rely on the system to drive
          safely.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Even if the proactive driving assist
          is functioning normally, the surrounding conditions
          recognized by the driver may differ from those detected

          driving due to sudden illness, etc., but not used when
          the driver is sleepy, lacks attention, or is in poor
          physical condition.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) As the effectiveness of the
          emergency driving stop system varies depending on various
          conditions, the same performance cannot always be
          achieved. There are certain conditions to operate the
          system. If the operating conditions are not met, the
          system will not operate.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) This system judges something
          abnormal about the driver based on the steering wheel
          operation status. If a normal driver intentionally
          discontinues operating, the system may operate. Also,
          even if the driver is in an abnormal condition, the
          system may not operate if the system cannot judge that
          the driver's hands are off the steering wheel when the
          driver is leaning against it.</p>

          condition may only be temporary.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) Before disconnecting connectors or
          removing/installing parts, determine the malfunctioning
          area by checking and writing down the vehicle condition
          at the time the malfunction occurred (DTC outputs
          etc.).</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) Be sure to check for DTCs related to
          other systems. Toyota Safety Sense may be influenced by
          malfunctions in other systems.</p>
          <p class="step1">HANDLING PRECAUTIONS</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) When removing or installing any ECUs
          or sensors, make sure that the ignition switch is off
          unless otherwise specified in the procedure.</p>
          <p class="step2">(b) After removing and installing any
          ECUs or sensor, make sure to check for DTCs and confirm
          that no DTCs are output.</p>
          <p class="step2">(c) The forward recognition camera is a
          precision part. Be sure to observe the following
          precautions when handling it.</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) Do not apply excessive force to the
          forward recognition camera or subject it to a strong
          impact.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) Do not disassemble the forward
          recognition camera.</p>
          <p class="step3">(3) Do not change the installation
          position of the forward recognition camera or modify the
          surrounding components.</p>
          <p class="step3">(4) Do not get the forward recognition
          camera wet or apply any liquids to it.</p>
          <p class="step3">(5) Do not shine bright lights into the
          forward recognition camera.</p>
          <p class="step3">(6) Do not touch the forward recognition
          camera lens when replacing the forward recognition
          camera.</p>
          <p class="notegen">NOTICE:</p>
          <p class="note">If the forward recognition camera lens is
          touched, replace the forward recognition camera with a

          <p class="step1">REPLACEMENT PRECAUTIONS</p>
          <p class="step2">(a) Millimeter wave radar sensor
          assembly:</p>
          <p class="step3">(1) When replacing the millimeter wave
          radar sensor assembly, always replace it with a new one.
          If a millimeter wave radar sensor assembly which was
          installed to another vehicle is used, the information
          stored in the millimeter wave radar sensor assembly will
          not match the information from the vehicle and a DTC may
          be stored.</p>
          <p class="step3">(2) When the millimeter wave radar
          sensor assembly has been replaced with a new one, it is
          necessary to perform millimeter wave radar sensor
          assembly beam axis alignment and to clear the vehicle
          control history. Before performing the Driving
          Adjustment, make sure to read Before Starting Driving
          Adjustment.</p>
