                        The operating range of the sensors and the vehicle speeds at which they operate are limited. When driving the vehicle, be sure to confirm that the area around the vehicle is safe (especially on the sides of the vehicle), use the brakes to control the vehicle speed and drive slowly.

                        If an abnormality is displayed, first confirm the status of the sensor. If an abnormality is displayed even though there is no ice, snow or dirt, the sensor may be operating abnormally.

                           If the malfunction display appears, visually check the sensor first. If the sensor is free of foreign matter but the malfunction display remains, the sensor may be malfunctioning.

                        When washing the vehicle with a high pressure car washer, do not allow water to make direct contact with the sensor area. The sensor may stop operating normally if subject to impact from high pressure water.

                        <li>
                        When washing the vehicle with a washer that uses steam, do not allow the steam to come too close to the sensor area. Steam may cause the sensor to stop operating normally.

                        <li>
                        The detection range of the sensor is limited to the vehicle corners and around the front/rear bumpers.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        The detection range may decrease or the sensor may become unable to detect anything at all, depending on the shape of the obstacle or conditions.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        The sensor may be unable to detect obstacles that are too close.

                        <li>
                        After an obstacle is detected, it may take a short amount of time for the indicator to operate and the buzzer to sound. The obstacle may approach the non-detection range before the indicator operates and the buzzer sounds, even when driving at low speeds.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        The sensor may not detect objects that are lower than the sensor, thin stakes and similar objects as they approach, even if they have been detected already.
                     </li>
                        <li>
                        When playing audio or using the air conditioning, sounds such as music or the fan noise may make it difficult to hear the buzzer sound.
